        <p>My favorite hobby is reading because when i read i get lost into another world, forgetting about all my problems, what I will do the next day. Insdead I think about how the characters of the book are, some are good ,some not as much and i think of their problems instead of mine.<br>Reading also develops my brains and gives me the ability to understand life in a much better fashion. Besides, there's a lot of room for grammar and language development. When we read a lot, we learn new words all the time.<br>Besides it makes me happy when I am sad, makes me more confident when I feel that I am a total failure, sometimes it encourage me to focus on my main goal.</p>
